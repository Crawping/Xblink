# Xblink
XBlink Based Chromium Project, It Just provide a example how to integrate chromium code based on content api


though I has many thoughts in may mind about chromium things, but till now, i still not ready for creating some big-guys base on chromium content api; On current web world has a bundle of great project based chromium, likes: electron, cef, miniblink, NW, QtWebEngine...etc, realy Amazing!;

so. My Xblink may just be a reference about how to set up a application based on chormium content api and do some Hack to make it more NONE-webbrowser; in the other hand, I wanna provide it as a example to someone who wanna "start up && play with chromium";

For myself, i wanna improve skills base on this project, deepin to compositing things, gpu things, painting things etc;
